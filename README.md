# CPS353 Software Engineering Project

Full stack website developed using M.E.R.N stack, Tailwind for the styling and JWToken for authentication.

Web application objective is to rate the different meals served in the universities dining hall.

This is a fork (copy from original repo: https://github.com/peternav2/SWE-Project/tree/main) and some of my last contributions in the project can be found under the branch with my name "development-rodo". 

_* **Disclaimer**: This was a group project, the code is a combined effort of 4 developers including myself.
